## ✨ High-Level Vision
**PiNet Web3 OS** transforms standard Raspberry Pi hardware into a sovereign decentralized compute unit. By combining the **Minima Protocol** for core decentralization with a hybrid AI stack (**Google Gemini + Local AirLLM**), we provide a "One-Click" solution for the emerging DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) economy.

## 🔥 Key Intelligence Features

### 🧠 Hybrid AI Strategy
PiNet intelligently routes requests between cloud and local providers:
- **Cloud (Gemini 3 Pro):** Leverages `gemini-3-pro-preview` for complex reasoning, visual diagnostics, and 4K media synthesis.
- **Local (AirLLM):** Executes "Free Llama" models locally. Inference is sharded across your Raspberry Pi cluster nodes for 100% private, zero-cost processing.

### 🌬️ Neural Thinking Mode
- Advanced architectural reasoning with a **32,768 token thinking budget**.
- Autonomous generation of **M.402 Agentic Payment** contracts.
- Real-time troubleshooting of P2P network topology.

### 📍 Grounding & Search
- Integrated `googleMaps` and `googleSearch` tools for real-time geographic and news-based awareness.

## 🛠️ Operating System Architecture

| Feature | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Node Alpha** | **NVMe Storage Hub & Orchestrator:** High-IOPS persistence for cluster sharding. |
| **Node Beta** | **Intelligence Hub (Hailo-8 NPU):** The dedicated Agentic Inference Gateway. |
| **Node Gamma** | **Sensory Node (Sense HAT):** Environmental grounding and real-time telemetry. |
| **Protocol** | Native Minima Layer 1 (Ultra-Decentralized) |
| **Messaging** | Maxima Secure Information Transport |
| **Payments** | M.402 Agentic Micro-Payment Streams |

## 🚀 DePAI Marketplace
Deploy specialized agents to your cluster to monetize hardware or automate maintenance:
- **AirLLM Worker:** Contributes compute to the local LLM pool.
- **Env Observer:** Uses Sense HAT data for proactive thermal management.
- **Data Sharder:** Distributes encrypted data across Node Alpha's NVMe array.

### 📥 Getting Started
1. Flash the **PiNet Web3 OS** image using the official Pi Imager.
2. Boot your Master Node (**Alpha**) to launch the **Setup Wizard**.
3. Connect additional nodes via Ethernet to auto-join the cluster.
4. Open the **PiNet AI Assistant** to manage your decentralized intelligence.
